# CustomVCTransitions

This is a sample proyect that shows how to implement custom view controller transitions in a reusable and maintainable way.

I have taken inspiration mostly from [VIPER](https://medium.com/cr8resume/viper-architecture-for-ios-project-with-simple-demo-example-7a07321dbd29) but with some modifications

In my architecture the view controller has a wireframe for the view controller to be presented as a dependency.

The main actors of this architecture are:

* View Controllers
* Wireframes
* Animator
* Interactive transitioing controller
